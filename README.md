# DETECTION-OF-MORPHED-FACES-USING-DEEPLEARNING
A deep learning-based project designed to detect morphed faces, enhancing security against identity fraud. This tool uses CNN architectures to analyze images, identify face morphing, and provide real-time feedback on image authenticity
# Detection of Morphed Faces Using Deep Learning

This project detects morphed faces using deep learning techniques. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for face morphing detection to prevent digital manipulation and identity fraud.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- Streamlit (for the web interface)

## Features
- Detects morphed faces in images using a CNN model.
- Provides a simple web interface using Streamlit for uploading images.
- Offers real-time feedback on whether the face in the image is morphed or authentic.
